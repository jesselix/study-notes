# Numbers

## Main number systems

type | byte | length |
--- | --- | --- |
N | Natural | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... |
Z | Integer | ..., −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... |
Q | Rational | a/b where a and b are integers and b is not 0 |
R | Real | The limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbers |
C | Complex | a + bi where a and b are real numbers and i is a formal square root of −1 |

$ N \subset Z \subset Q \subset R \subset C $
